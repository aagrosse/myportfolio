This is my portfolio framework for showcasing my work.

This Homework was challenging:

Being the anxiety driven individual that I am, I started on the project way to early and ended up going down a lot of frustrating rabbit holes teaching myself code that we hadnt covered yet in class.  On the flip side, it made learning it in class a lot easier since I had already fumbled through a lot of the topics on my own.

I ended up doing a lot of Google Foo, taking snipits of code and testing them out in my project, and just trying a lot of suggestions made by visual studio code to see how the elements would react, and ultimately refined my product into the end result.

Im not 100% on what the reset does other than just optimizing for multiple browsers but adding it fixed many of the problems i was seeing and gave me a path forward to a solution.

I found some navigation button code that i liked but ultimately discarded because 1) i want to sit down and understand it more before implementing it and 2) I wanted to focus on testing the limits of the core of the project.
